Civipedia is an online community of practice for anyone who wants to make their city better. 

CfA’s OSQA aims to support two kinds of leaders -- beginners and
experts. For the experts -- anyone from city staff to local neighborhood
mavens -- we hope to create an easy avenue to share their knowledge of
special interest and get recognized for it. For beginners -- anyone
newly inspired to get involved -- we hope to create a rich library of
local expertise to draw from, so that starting from scratch isn’t so
daunting.

There is a wide gap between intention and action. We believe people want
to have pride in their communities and will volunteer their time to
improve their neighborhoods, be that cleaning up a street, hosting a
block party or starting a community garden. But taking the first step
can be the hardest, and the sooner initial questions are answered, the
more likely positive change and civic leadership will happen.
